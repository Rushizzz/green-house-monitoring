# green-house-monitoring

This project aims to automate the monitoring processes of a plant inside a greenhouse with respect to its surrounding conditions. The project uses an Arduino Uno board, a DHT11 sensor, a soil moisture sensor, an LDR sensor, and a Wi-Fi module to collect and send data to a web server. The web server displays the data on a dashboard and allows the user to control the greenhouse parameters remotely. The project also uses Firebase as a cloud database to store and retrieve the data.
